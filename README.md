#databases
In this sprint, I learned to use SQL to define multi-table schemas and write SQL queries to extract data from the database. Then I created a MySQL database to persist data for the chatterbox-server (which was built in a previous sprint). Then I refactored the database to use Sequelize (an ORM). 

####Note
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
